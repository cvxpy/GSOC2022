# GSOC2022

CVXPY is an open source Python-embedded modeling language for convex optimization problems. 
It lets you express your problem in a natural way that follows the math, 
rather than in the restrictive standard form required by solvers.

[CVXPY](https://www.cvxpy.org/) will be a participating sub-organization in [NumFOCUS](http://numfocus.org/)'s application
for [Google Summer of Code 2022](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). For more information about this application see:

- [NumFOCUS's main GSoC page](https://github.com/numfocus/gsoc)
