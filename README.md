# GSOC2022

CVXPY is an open source Python-embedded modeling language for convex optimization problems. 
It lets you express your problem in a natural way that follows the math, 
rather than in the restrictive standard form required by solvers.

[CVXPY](https://www.cvxpy.org/) will be a participating sub-organization in [NumFOCUS](http://numfocus.org/)'s application
for [Google Summer of Code 2022](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). For more information about this application see:

## Ideas

### Performance benchmarks with CI

#### Abstract

Improving the speed of problem compilation is a major development goal for CVXPY. We need a thorough benchmark suite to measure improvements, ideally deployed via continuous integration. It should be easy to see the performance changes due to any PR or commit, and to track performance changes over time.

### Support for non-convex quadratic objectives and constraints

#### Abstract

CVXPY currently supports convex optimization problems and mixed-integer programs. We would like to extend support to (nonconvex) nonlinear problems, 
such as those solved by [Ipopt](https://coin-or.github.io/Ipopt/) or [Bonmin](https://github.com/coin-or/Bonmin).
